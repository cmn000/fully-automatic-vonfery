# Smart Embodied Pain Assessment System: AI-Powered Precision Pain Research

## Project Overview

Pain, recognized as the "fifth vital sign" in clinical practice, demands objective and quantitative assessment for the development of novel analgesics and the study of pain pathway mechanisms. Traditional von Frey pain tests, relying on manual probing and visual judgment, suffer from high variability and low efficiency.

This project aims to revolutionize pain assessment by introducing a **Smart Embodied Pain Assessment System**. Empowered by cutting-edge edge AI, this system enables precise, efficient, and objective measurement of paw withdrawal thresholds in mice, offering a high-throughput and highly objective new paradigm for analgesic drug discovery and pain mechanism research.

## Core Technologies and Innovations

This system integrates robotics, high-definition vision, multi-modal physiological signal acquisition, and edge AI inference to form a complete perceive-decide-act intelligent closed-loop:

* **±0.1 mm Precise Stimulation:** A **three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm** combined with **120 fps high-definition vision** achieves ultra-precise (±0.1 mm) stimulation of the mouse paw, significantly enhancing measurement repeatability and accuracy.
* **Multi-Modal Physiological Signal Acquisition:** The system fuses **infrared vision** and **millimeter-wave radar** for multi-modal sensing, synchronously collecting physiological data from mice to provide comprehensive objective evidence of pain responses.
* **Edge AI Empowerment:** An integrated **Transformer-Fusion model** performs local inference with ultra-low latency of **less than 15 milliseconds**, enabling real-time, efficient perception and closed-loop control of stimulation strategies.
* **Intelligent Closed-Loop & High-Throughput:** The entire system operates without human intervention, forming a fully autonomous perceive-decide-act intelligent closed-loop. Compared to traditional methods, the system boosts sample testing speed by **10 times** and reduces data variability by **40%**, significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.
